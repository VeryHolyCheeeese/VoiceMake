# VoiceMake
### Origins
The origins of VoiceMake is of a meme i saw, it was something like "small brain storing code in github, big brain storing code in screenshots" so i thought, Hey why not saying the code out loud recording it and then storing that. So I had the brilliant idea of making a compiler that listens to the recording and outputs the C++ file and then uses GCC to build it. Ofc i cannot use a normal Language model so i have to actually do something for the project

### Vosk
I will be using VOSK with the big boi EN_US language model with some adjustments, Because i highly doubt the small EN_US model is that accurate and i cannot use a normal big boi en_US language model because i highly doubt it has "COLON" and "SEMI COLON" and etc.

### How do i contribute?
You can help me by adding code terminology and characters that are not already in the language model into the language model.
And you can also contribute into the actual code.

### Installation?
AFter the initial release the installation section will become avaivable.
